# Data Risk Tool
## Data Risk Tool

In accordance with National Health Service (NHS) guidance and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation, all organisations in the United Kingdom handling sensitive data have a duty to assess and minimise associated risks. Hospitals handle large amounts of routinely collected patient data that may be de-identified and used for research. The NHS and data protection legislation allows for de-identified data to be used for research without conventional research ethics committee approval but projects should be risk-assessed by the trust. All research studies must be approved by a Research and Development (R&D) Department or equivalent, who check that the research has the correct regulatory approvals, including assessment by the Health Research Authority and/or review by the NHS Research Ethics Committee service, when required.

This data risk tool aims to quantify the data risks associated with each project and is informed by guidance from General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO), General Medical Council (GMC), Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Five Safes, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the NHS. This data risk tool identifies risks associated with each project with a view to ensure that data is only shared where efforts have been made to minimise risks. The tool is designed to provide feedback to the researchers themselves to highlight preventative measures and impacts of risks that they may not have considered. 

### Examples of such risks include:

- Through inadequate de-identification or lack of safeguarding, researchers may be able identify specific patients;
- Through inadequate security, malicious persons may be able to access the data, causing threats to patient confidentiality and reputational damage;
- Through inadequate security, malicious persons may be able to edit the data, and so compromise its accuracy and harm the results of the study;
- Through inadequate security, malicious persons may be able to scam or target vulnerable patients with identity theft;
- Through inadequate security, malicious persons may be able to access personally identifiable information, potentially leading to medical identity theft
- Accidental leakage of sensitive patient data through preventable human error.

### What is covered by this tool?:

Any study that use routinely collected patient data, including secondary uses of study data, that do not have specific research consent or a Section 251 consent waiver (which allows the common law duty of confidentiality to be temporarily lifted).

### What is exempt from this tool?:
- Projects using data from public data repositories (e.g. Kaggle, Google Datasets);
- Projects where data is sourced from other health organisations; and
- Projects using entirely synthetic data that does not correspond with real patients, although the creation of synthetic data would require approval first.

The data risk tool encompasses several domains of data usage in order to calculate an overall risk score. The risk tool is designed to capture information about the likelihood, severity and reputational hazard of different risks. Most elements of the risk score are modifiable and each section is accompanied by advice on how to reduce risk scores. The baseline for each project risk score is set based on the type of data that is being requested. High risk data requests can have scores reduced if safeguards are in place to minimise risks. Similarly, the score of projects requesting low-risk data can be increased if the processing and storage of the data is outside the control of CUH, as this increases security and reputational risks. All projects are subject to panel review, which includes patient and public representation. Projects with high risk scores will not be considered by the panel until safeguards are suggested to reduce the score.

The risk tool will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Scores will automatically be submitted to the review board on completion. The online submission form must be completed in a single session but a paper version of the tool is available in order to draft and plan responses prior to submission. It is expected that a completed version of the risk tool will be accompanied by the full project proposal which includes supporting documents to allow further contextualised scrutiny of the statements in the review.
